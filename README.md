# Web RTC Developer Challenge 

Implement a One-to-One Video Conferencing App.  

* The App should be implemented using Web-RTC protocol 
* The App should be a pure Web-App and should not be dependent on any plugin.
* Similar to typical conferencing App , user should be able to host a meeting.
* Each meeting should have a unique URL , that can be shared with other user.
* User who has the URL , should be able to join the meeting.
* Users should be able to see/talk to each other , similar to any typical Video Conferencing App.
* There should be an option to Play/Pause Video and Audio.

### For Brownie Points

* Ability to chat with other user online using webrtc
* Please state what strategy you would use to make it work across wierd NAT configurations at home routers and enterprise network.
* Please state what security concerns you would try to mitigate.

# Technology Stack

* We prefer that the back-end and signalling server should be implemented on **Python** based libs.
* UI you can choose library like (JQuery, Angular, ReactJS etc..).

# Deliverables

Once you are done, please share with us:
1. Source code link (GitHub, BitBucket, etc)
2. URL where you have **deployed** the project. You need to deploy the WebApp on some cloud platform and provide us the URL for the same. **This step is very important** 
3. Share the steps on using the Web App.

# Important things

* Modularize your code well. Putting everything in one file is not good.
* Use external DB/cache if required. Storing on local files and local variables is not desirable.
* Put proper comments in code , so that we can understand the function usage etc..

# Specs

* **UI Design specs**: Please implement the UI similar to Google Meet. You need not to copy everything from Google Meet. Just take inspiration from it's design.
